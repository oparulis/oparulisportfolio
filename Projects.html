        <p class="lead">In this project for my Design II class, we were given the challenge of creating a poster based on a current issue. When we received the assignment it was around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, so many of my classmates and I chose this as our topic. I refined my focus to President Trumpâ€™s delay in response to the virus. This poster was originally in a timeline series of three, however this was the strongest design from the set which also encapsulates the message of the others.  </p>

        <p class="lead">Each week in my History of Graphic Design class we are tasked with combining the old with the new. We are instructed to take whichever historic design style we are learning about that week and make a poster applying it to a modern idea or event. For this assignment, the class was focused on the wood-type prints of the 1800s. I took this and used it for a Harry Styles concert poster, not only having a modern event but also a nod to Philadelphia.</p>

        <p class="lead">I have to admit this project for my Design III class was my absolute favorite of my assignments at Jefferson. For it, we were told to take one of our favorite record albums and redesign it with a focus on typography. I was ecstatic over this since not only do I collect vinyl, but also my dream career path would be to use my graphic design knowledge in the music industry. The album I chose was Dream Police by Cheap Trick, my favorite band. With this, I created a focus on the eccentric sweaters and jackets the guitarist of the band is often pictured in. I created a jean jacket and photographed myself wearing it for the album cover. The A-side sticker on the vinyl itself had the theme carried onto it with the background of it being a circular patch. Other elements on the packaging included close-ups of denim, 1970s pins, and patches to all better incorporate the theme. </p>
